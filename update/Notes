* we went with adapting "app.update.url" directly (and do not use
  "app.update.url.override") for the following reasons:
  a) using a URL pointing to our servers does break the whole build (extensions
     are disabled, etc.), not sure yet why
  b) we make sure that Mozilla's servers are not contacted for application
     updates as there is no update URL anymore
  c) "app.update.url.override" was for testing purposes only anyway

* we should consider the update policy: By default automatic updates, and no 2MB
    limit for free services and by default not over JonDonym (checkbox whether
    one wants the updates over it, though), right!?

* UI change, if cert validation fails + UI change, if update server cannot be
  reached + probably in onError() in aboutDialog.js: the onError handler in 
  Checker does already generate a quite detailed error status message we could
  evaluate in onError()

* parsing the update.xml in onLoad() before checking the certs is on
  purpose, see: #583408. Not sure if we want to keep that, though. Does only
  hold for background update checks!?

* what about the license of JonDoBrowser and the option for the license URL in
  updates!? 
  - not sure regarding the license but I think we should neither include a
    license nor a billboard URL but rather let the update run silently in the
    background *as long as we don't touch the user's profile directory*

* big question: What do we want to update? Only the application i.e. the
  Firefox + patches or (parts of) the profile folder as well?
