# As we are releasing official builds with VS2010 there is no need to add
# linker flags like DYNAMICBASE or NXCOMPAT as they are on by default. We do
# not need the GS compiler flag either as this is on by default as well.
# That leaves the SAFESEH flag. This may or may get not used depending on
# the circumstances. But building it with VC2009 it is enabled by default, too.
# Thus, assuming this holds for a build with VC2010 as well.
